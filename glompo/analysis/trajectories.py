       :align: center


    Parameters
    ----------
    k
        Number of dimensions in the hypercube the trajectory traverses.
    levels
        Number of levels into which each dimension of the hypercube is discretized.
    groupings
        Optional :math:`k \\times g` matrix of 0s and 1s, mapping parameters to one of :math:`g` groups.
    base_pt
        Optional `k` length vector representing the trajectory starting point. Must be in the lower quadrant of the grid
        such that the addition of the step size in any dimension results in a point which is, itself, in the grid.
        Randomly generated in the grid if not supplied. **Not** included in the final trajectory set.
    include_short_range
        If :obj:`True`, the trajectory will be extended by a further :math:`g` points located at 1% of the distance
        between adjacent points in the trajectory.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        Sequence of :math:`g + 1` or :math:`2g + 1` vectors in `k` dimensional unit space representing a Manhattan style
        trajectory through it. Where :math:`g \\leq k` is the number of factor groups given by `groupings`.

    Notes
    -----
    The Elementary Effects sensitivity method allows parameter sensitivities to be calculated for groups of parameters,
    not just individual parameters. Trajectories for this type of analysis are produced by providing the `groupings`
    matrix.

    Note that `base_pt` is **not** included in the returned set. This is the opposite behaviour to
    :func:`make_radial_trajectory` but was chosen this way to match literature.

    Including short range points doubles the expense of evaluating the trajectory but provides valuable sensitivity
    information about the smoothness of the surrounding function. Large differences between long-range and short-range
    can indicate an especially pathological function.

    Including short-range analyses can also be critical in residual analyses (see :class:`ResidualAnalysis`).

    `Campolongo et al. (2007) <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2006.10.004>`_. However, such a method is horrendously
    expensive due to combinatorial explosion, even at small dimensions. The algorithm used here is much cheaper but
    guaranteed to only be locally maximal in terms of spread. Analysis by
    `Ruano et al (2012) <https://doi.org/10.1016/J.ENVSOFT.2012.03.008>`_ showed the difference to be small.

    This function is distinct from multiple calls to :func:`make_winding_stair_trajectory`, since the trajectories are
    spread in space relative to one another, rather than randomly dispersed.
