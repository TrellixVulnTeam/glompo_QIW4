GloMPO comes bundled with several examples to get you started. They can all be found in the ``examples``
directory of the package.

Minimal
   The :download:`minimal <../examples/minimal.py>` example configures the minimum number of GloMPO options and
   demonstrates that very simple configurations are possible.

Customized
   The :download:`customized <../examples/customized.py>` example guides users through each of the options available to
   configure the manager and will give the user a good overview of what is possible.

Nudging
   The :download:`nudging <../examples/customized.py>` example is broadly equivalent to the customized one, but
   includes configuration settings for GloMPO to share information between optimizers in real-time. One should observe
   a dramatic improvement in GloMPO's performance.

After working through the examples, the user is encouraged to read further in the documentation to get a proper
understanding of all of GloMPO's components.
